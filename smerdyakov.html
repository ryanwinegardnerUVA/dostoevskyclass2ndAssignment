      <p style="margin-left: 10px; text-align: left;"> Smerdyakov is presented as Goya's <i> Saturn Devouring his Son. </i> This highly disturbing image is hard to look at directly. In this way, Smerdyakov's own humanity is disgusting to the Karamazovs around him, and often to the reader. The Saturn-figure, driven by lust or hunger or hatred, insatiable and manic, destroys a dehumanized and anonymous anthropomorphic form. Smerdyakov's psychology leads him to impulsive acts of violence. It leads him to manipulate the people around him so as to allow the death of Fyodor. Yet one can almost see a quiet terror in Saturn's eyes. A reaction belying that this violence is not formless. That it unnerves even the perpetrator. </p>

      <h2 style= "color: #ff0000">“As a child he was fond of hanging cats and then burying them with ceremony. He would put on a sheet, which served as a vestment, chant, and swing something the dead cat as if it were a censer. It was all done on the sly, in great secrecy” (132, Brothers Karamazov).</h2>
   
    <p> <b>The anti-buffoon. </b> Smerdyakov, possessing an ego that sought to transgress his meager position and to prove his superiority to the insane posse of nobility that was kept unequal to, by irking those around them. He developed and wielded an uncanny ability to this end: </br>
“Grigory was dumbfounded and stared goggle-eyed at the orator. Though he did not understand very well what was being said, he did suddenly understand some of all this gibberish, and stood looking like a man who had just run his head into a wall” (138, Brothers Karamazov). </p>

<p> A bastard child, his mother, a holy fool, was presumed raped by the sensualist, Fyodor Pavlovich (105, Brothers Karamazov), who would nonetheless patronize him as a chef, and take such a liking to him as to prevent his adopted father from mercilessly beating him, (134, Brothers Karamazov).  </p>

<p>He became obsessed with self-image. “Smerdyakov spent almost the whole of this salary on clothes, pomade, perfume, and so on. Yet he seemed to despise the female sex as much as the male, and behaved solemnly, almost inaccessibly, with it" (134, Brothers Karamazov). His image-obsession was rooted in the realization that he was powerless, stuck in a low position despite his intellect, despite his worth. That he must be patronized by his drunkard father, rapist of his mother, would surely have pained him. That his adopted father considered him to not be a human being (132, Brothers Karamazov) would have driven him to cruelty. He enacted his fantasies of grandeur on anything more powerless than him. “As a child he was fond of hanging cats and then burying them with ceremony. He would put on a sheet, which served as a vestment, chant, and swing something the dead cat as if it were a censer. It was all done on the sly, in great secrecy” (132, Brothers Karamazov).  </p>

<p>These early performances were a ritual in creating, if only temporarily, a reality wherein he wasn’t the lowly and hated Smerdyakov, son of the stinking one, protected only by the rapist of his mother. It is from these early days that Smerdyakov developed his taste for cruel violence.  </p>

<p>He became attached to Ivan Karamazov, his brother neither in name nor in noble title, but only by the vandal blood of their mutual father. They had a fateful, a fatal conversation before the murder of Fyodor. Ivan had begun to really hate Smerdyakov (283), perhaps solely because “things worked out in such a way that Smerdyakov apparently, God knows why, finally came to consider himself somehow in league, as it were, with Ivan Fyodorovich” (284, Brothers Karamazov).  </p>

<p>They spoke of many things. But, “Ivan Fyodorovich soon realized that the sun, moon, and stars were not the point at all, that while the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject, for Smerdyakov it was of completely third-rate importance, and that he was after something quite different (283, Brothers Karamazov). Rather, the importance was to desperately prove, to Ivan, and to himself, that they were equals. That of the four issues of Fyodor, Ivan and Smerdyakov, both 24, were the same. That they were both superior to the whole rest of the raving, goggle-eyed, drooling Karamazov mob.  </p>

<p> In this way, you can understand Smerdyakov’s comment to Ivan, just before Ivan leaves. “So it’s true what they say, that it’s always interesting to talk with an intelligent man,’ Smerdyakov replied firmly, giving Ivan Fyodorvich a penetrating look” (297, Brothers Karamazov).  </p>
