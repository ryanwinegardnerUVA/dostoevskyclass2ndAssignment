  <p style="margin-left: 10px; text-align: left;">Polzunkov is depicted here as Van Gogh's <i>Peasant Burning Weeds</i>. Where the image shows a man toiling alone on a hellish plain, Polzunkov is a man whose great travail in life is taken in the most abject solitude. To entertain and to be misunderstood. To even be hated by the narrator of his own story. His own pitiful voice echoing back to him as the scornful laughter of his friends. </p>
</div>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #ff0000"> “In short, he was a martyr in the full sense of the term, but a martyr who was utterly useless and therefore utterly comic” (253 Polzunkov). </h2>
      


      <p> <b style= "color: #ff0000"> The Buffoon</b>. Polzunkov might have been the bastard child of an old Prussian, “That old retired junker, though, he would not allow me into his house...had also, <b>perhaps not mistakenly, treated me like his own son</b>” (257 Polzunkov). In this way, you can see how his buffoonery may come from the same place as Smerdyakov's cruelty. Some kind of identity-void that curses children in these positions, that pushed Smerdyakov to villainy, that pushed Polzunkov to incessantly humiliate himself. </p>

<p>What we understand of Polzunkov’s life is unclear. Perhaps it will be made clear by this project. The narrator of his story does not respect him. He affords little detail to his upbringing, and even less to his real humanity. What we get from his narrator is a horror of humiliation and buffoonery. </p>

<p>It is clear that humiliation makes him squirm, but that this humiliation is the only thing he has: “he seemed afraid of being laughed at, and yet he practically made his living out of being an eternal buffoon” (251 Polzunkov). Like Smerdyakov, he was obsessed with image, though we only receive this in small detail from a narrator who despises and belittles Polzunkov: “The most ridiculous thing of all was that he was dressed...even with a certain degree of refinement and with a feeble impulse towards respectability” (252 Polzunkov).</p>

<p>Polzunkov had wanted to be something else. Perhaps, it can be surmised, that he wanted to be considered kin of Fedosei Nikolaich. Maybe this was a kind of escape from his own identity. He playacts as a child around Fedosei: “And I, like an idiot, said: ‘April Fool! Happy holiday to you, Fedosei Nikolaich!’ Just like a little boy who has been hiding behind his grandmother’s armchair and then suddenly shouts” (262 Polzunkov).</p>

<p>He outright begs to be considered his son: “Why are you insulting me, Fedosei Nikolaich? In a certain sense I’m your son...When are you going to start treating me like a father?” (258 Polzunkov). Where Smerdyakov was slaying cats and plotting with Ivan, Polzunkov was playing jokes with his <i> father </i> and acting like a child. </p>

<p>Yet it can be gathered that Polzunkov was a master orator. He could certainly control a crowd: “The roar of laughter which had gradually begun to build up on all sides ended by completely drowning the voice of the narrator, who had worked himself up into a state of genuine ecstasy; he stopped talking, let his eyes pass over the company for a few moments, and then suddenly, as though he had been carried away by some whirlwind, waved a hand in the air and burst out laughing as though he really found his situation a comical one” (261 Polzunkov). </p>

<p>But because of his familiarity with abuse and humiliation, he wasn’t afraid to debase himself for the benefit of the crowd: “The spectacle of a rather well-dressed gentleman jumping on a chair and shouting at the top of his voice had indeed aroused general attention” (253 Polzunkov).</p>

<p style= "color: #ff0000"> <b>It is this that draws attention to Polzunkov’s humanity. He screams for attention, for love, for respect. He loves his fellow man so much that he will use any joke to make them happy. Although his own identity is subservient to the people around him, he curates a new identity, and even a certain power, through performance. As the buffoon, he is impelled to humiliate himself. </b> </p>
