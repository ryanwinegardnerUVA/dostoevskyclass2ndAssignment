    <h1 style= "color: #ff0000" >Welcome to <i>Dostoevsky World </i></h1>
      <p>This is a webpage that Fyodor Dostoevsky, in his visionary genius, created shortly before his death in 1880. Not to be deterred by the fact that the computer, the internet, and the html language wouldn't be created until late into the century following his death, the avant-garde Dostoevsky left behind manuscripts for this project, <i> Dostoevsky World</i>. This project was apparently to link all of his books in one great body of self-referential literature.</p>
      
      <p>An enigma that would trouble Dostoevsky scholars for decades, this manuscript was purposefully kept secret and under lock and key in a bunker somewhere in Siberia. The questions it raised by its mere existence were known to drive scholars to insanity... How did he know about the internet? How did he know how to use HTML? What purpose would it serve him to link all of his literature?</p>
      
      <p>And yet another, more troubling problem: why would Dostoevsky use his limited time on this project to link an obscure character from his writing before the 1860s, Polzunkov, with the villain of <i>Brothers Karamazov </i>, Smerdyakov? </p>
      
      <p>I, the faithful intern that was tasked with creating this webpage, present Dostoevsky's mysterious work as it was found, with only minor embellishments, because I cannot read the Russian language, that script in which he wrote this manuscript. Thus, all work is derived from what I think the source text must be...</p>
